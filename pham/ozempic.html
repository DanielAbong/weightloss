<h4>Increase in Amylase and Lipase</h4><br>
<p>In a placebo-controlled study, patients experienced an increase of Amylase and Lipase from baseline. These changes were not found in the placebo-treated patients.</p><br>

<h4>Cholelithiasis</h4><br>

<h4>Hypoglycemia</h4><br>
<p>Even though Ozempic (semaglutide) does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), it may occur happen if taken with other diabetes medications. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about whether you need to have your other medication doses adjusted. Hypoglycemia may also be caused by consuming alcohol, not enough exercise, or not getting enough calories.

  <li>Do not inject where the skin is bruised, scaly, hard, tender, or damaged.</li>
</ul><br>

<h4>Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors</h4><br>
<p>If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be showing elevated or thyroid nodules from a physical examination or neck imaging, patients should be referred to an endocrinologist. Patients should be informed that Semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents and that this has not been conclusive in humans. Patients must report any symptoms of hoarseness, dysphagia, dyspnea, or a lump in the neck to their physician.</p><br>

<h4>Pancreatitis</h4><br>
<p>Patients should be informed of the risks of pancreatitis. In glycemic control trials, acute and chronic pancreatitis has been reported. Patients need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of pancreatitis which can include ongoing severe abdominal pain and vomiting. If signs of pancreatitis are confirmed, Ozempic treatment should be discontinued and your doctor should be consulted.</p><br>

<h4>Diabetic Retinopathy</h4><br>
<p>In a 2-year trial, more complications of diabetic retinopathy occurred in patients taking Ozempic (3.0%) vs those taking the placebo (1.8%). Patients in the trial had type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. It was found that the patients who had a high risk of diabetic retinopathy were predisposed based on their family history compared to those without. This is why patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored clos</p><br>

<p>If patients experience a rapid improvement in glucose control, this may indicate a worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</p><br>

<h4>Hypoglycemia</h4><br>
<p>When Ozempic is used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (ie sulfonylureas), patients were at higher risk of hypoglycemia (high blood sugar levels).</p><br>

<h4>Do not share Ozempic pens</h4><br>
<p>Ozempic pens should not be shared among patients even if they show similar symptoms and the needle has been changed. Sharing pens can lead to spreading infection and transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><br>

<h4>Acute Kidney Injury</h4><br>
<p>Reports have shown that patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists experienced acute kidney injury and worsening chronic renal failure. As a result, patients would require hemodialysis. Most of the reported events that happened with patients who have shown symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and dehydration have occurred. Renal function should be monitored closely in patients for severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions in patients taking escalated doses.</p><br>

<h4>Hypersensitivity</h4><br>
<p>If hypersensitivity occurs, patients should discontinue use and monitor until symptoms are resolved. Serious symptoms of hypersensitivity include angioedema and anaphylaxis. Patients with a history of these two reactions should be treated with caution and treated with another GLP-1 receptor agonist. Patients who have a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with other GLP-1 receptors should be treated with caution.</p><br>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4><br>
<p>Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should be advised of the potential risks to a fetus. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant or planning pregnancy. If diabetes is poorly managed during pregnancy, this can increase the risk of complications such as ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, birth defects, macrosomia, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortions, delivery complications, and stillbirth.</p><br>

<h4>Renal Failure and Dehydration</h4><br>
<p>Patients should be advised by their physicians about the possible risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions if they are using Ozempic. Patients should avoid fluid depletion. Doctors should explain the possible symptoms of renal impairment and the possible requirement of dialysis if renal failure occurs.
